# RuneScape Archaeology Assistant

A small tool written with Astro/TypeScript to help calculate useful quantities for materials and artefacts gathered with the archaeology skill in RuneScape.

I'm just doing this for myself as a fun project and to play with Astro and TypeScript.

[Use it yourself here!](https://pwschaedler.github.io/rs-archaeology-helper-web/)

## Planned Features

-   List materials needed to restore an artefact.
-   Aggregate needed materials over multiple types of artefacts and multiple numbers of the same artefact.
-   Track how many materials a user has, calculate how many more are needed, and provide what the remaining porter charges will be after getting materials.
-   Add batch input to goal.

Someone has written an Alt1 plugin called [ArchMatCounter](https://github.com/ZeroGwafa/ArchMatCounter) that basically does the same thing but more conveniently.
